#### Characteristics

* Displays git information in the command prompt when available.
* Indicates 'master' branch with a distinctive color, encouraging the use of feature-branches (useful when development is done using pull requests)
* If the last command was failed, the indicator would be red, otherwise it's green
* If active, displays the Python virtualenv in the prompt (compatible with [VirtualFish](https://virtualfish.readthedocs.io/))
